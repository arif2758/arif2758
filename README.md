### Hey! 👋 I'm Arif
a passionate Web Developer specializing in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) ⚡.  
I create fast, reliable, responsive, and scalable web solutions tailored to the unique needs of each project.

I’m proficient in technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Ant Design, and GSAP — which I often use to craft smooth, high-performance animations 💫 that enhance user experience.  
For larger projects, I focus on building polished and engaging user interfaces ✨.  
On smaller projects, I take full ownership of the development process — from concept to deployment 🛠️.

Committed to remote collaboration 🌐, clear communication 📬, and timely delivery ⏱️, I’m excited to help bring your ideas to life 🚀.
